# country-state-metadata-generator
The county and state metadata generator allows administrators or developers to quickly load metadata for the countries and states they wish to support into their implementation of the [Kinetic Growth](https://www.kineticgrowth.com) application.

## Usage
This application can be accessed [here](http://kg-country-state-metadata-gen.herokuapp.com/). Simply select the countries you would like to support and click the **Download** button to download a zip file containing all required metadata files. These files can then be deployed to your sandbox or production org using the force.com migration tool or an IDE.
